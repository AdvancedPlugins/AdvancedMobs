# AdvancedMobs Plugin

**AdvancedMobs** is the ultimate enhancement to vanilla Minecraft gameplay. This plugin introduces custom mythical mobs to your world, transforming how Minecraft is played. Engage with new monsters in caves, encounter advanced mobs across various biomes, and create dynamic farms.

**No mods, resource packs, or texture packs required!**

## Key Features

### Custom Mobs
- **Random Spawns:** Custom mobs spawn naturally in the world, just like vanilla mobs. They appear depending on biomes, time of day, and other conditions (e.g., hostile mobs in dark areas or caves).
- **Peaceful and Hostile Mobs:** Custom mobs can be peaceful or hostile. Hostile mobs deal damage to players realistically, considering armor and other modifiers.
- **Immersive Sounds:** Custom mobs use vanilla sounds for a fully immersive experience.
- **Breeding:** Peaceful mobs can be bred using items specified in the configuration (this feature can be disabled).

### Loot and Persistence
- **Custom Loot:** Each mob drops its own specified loot, which can be customized in the configuration.
- **Persistent Mobs:** Custom mobs persist through server restarts and area changes, ensuring your mobs and farms remain intact.

### No Additional Requirements
- **No Resource Packs Needed:** Custom mobs use player skins, so no additional packs are required for players to join the server.
- **ModelEngine Support:** Includes 2 models that require resource packs via ModelEngine, but 20+ mobs can be used without any additional dependencies.

### Boss Creation
- **Build Bosses:** Create custom bosses using block patterns similar to Withers in Minecraft. You can design patterns with any blocks and there is no size limit for patterns.

### Mob and Spawner Stacking (Optional)
- **Stack Mobs and Spawners:** Optionally stack both vanilla and custom mobs and spawners. This feature is disabled by default. Learn more about stacking [here](https://mobs.advancedplugins.net/advancedmobs/mechanics/mobs-and-spawners-stacking).

### Spawner Levels
- **Upgrade Spawners:** When stacking is enabled, you can upgrade spawners to increase spawn frequency, spawn amount multiplier, and adjust pricing for each level.

### Extensive Configuration
- **Fully Customizable:** Configure all messages, loot, spawning rates, biomes, and more. Adjust everything from wild mob spawning rates to spawner-specific settings.

### Track Kill Stats and Discoveries
- **Mob Discovery Tracker:** Keep track of kills and discovered species with the built-in discovery tracker.

### Supported Plugins
- **ModelEngine 3.0.0+:** Optional support for custom models.
